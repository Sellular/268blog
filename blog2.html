                Although they may seem mundane and simple, buttons are going to be a very important and simple way to interact with a website.

            <p>
                As we continue on in 268, learning javascript and more backend orientated ideas, buttons are going to be a main interaction point between user and website. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv_F6LPmxs">This video</a> here does a great job just showing the bare basics of buttons and what they can do. Once we learn more about javascript and backend website functionality, having a simple way to trigger a script, query, or change in the website will be very useful and are also abundent in any website available.

            <div class="code">
                &lt;button onclick="window.location.href = 'https://google.com';"&gt;GoogleButton&lt;/button&gt;
            </div>
            <div> Results in: <button onclick="window.location.href = 'https://google.com';">Google Button</button>
            <p>
                Buttons were one of the first things that caught my interest when I started fiddling with JavaFX in high school. That was when I started to develop my interest with linking frontend with backend and buttons are always a useful tool for such things.
